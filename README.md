# The6ixPrediction
An implementation of Image Classification for numbers using simple neural networks and AI/Deep Learning fundamentals under the supervision of the Coding Hive. We trained our model first with a pre-set database of different numbers before taking our own pictures to test with, learning how inaccuracy happens.
